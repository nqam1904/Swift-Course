/**
 User-Defined Data Types in Swift

 User-defined data types allow us to create customized data types according to their requirements. They provide more flexibility and abstraction. Following are some user-defined data types supported by Swift âˆ’
 Type Name                     Description
 Structures(struct)            They are value types; means they can have copied when passed around in the program. They are good for representing simple data structure.
 Class                              They are reference types; means they are passed as a reference. They are good for complex data models and objects.
 Enumerations(Enum)     They are used to define a group of related values. They are good at representing finite set.
 Protocols                        They define a blueprint for methods and properties that is good for a particular task or piece of functionality.
